Responses:

Request:
  - partnerUserId: Validation description could be less confusing
Responses:
  - 404 - "Agent with passed and mac was not foundip" <-- foundip?

[GET|DELETE] /agents/:partner_agent_id
Path template "/agents/{partner_agent_id}" is semantically identical to at least one other path.
Path templates must be semantically unique - which means you cannot have a path /agents/{partner_agent_id} and also a path /agents/{agent_id}.

[PUT] /agents/:id/name <-- is "name" a path param or body param?

[PUT] /agents/:id/mode
Responses:
  - only 200

Path template "/agents/{partnerAgentId}/mode" is semantically identical to "/agents/:id/mode.

Responses:
  - only 200

[PUT] /agents/:id/dhcp
Responses:
  - only 200

[GET|PUT] /agents/:id/static-ips

TODO: all endpoints between page 67 - 78 from pdf
`access-profiles` and `schedules`
All except:
- [GET] /access-profiles/{accessProfileId}/devices
- [PUT] /access-profiles/{accessProfileId}/devices
- [GET] /access-profiles/{accessProfileId}/activity-logs

Update 21-03-2019
[GET] /access-profiles/{accessProfileId}/activity-logs - Incomplete

Not implemented:
  - [GET|POST] /access-profiles/{accessProfileId}/domain/[allowed|blocked] - not working
  - [DELETE] /access-profiles/{accessProfileId}/domain/[allowed|blocked|bulk-domains] - Incompatible
      Request:
        - Request Body is not supported for DELETE operations.
        - The HTTP specification only supports a body in the HTTP request for the POST, PUT, and OPTIONS methods. As a result, only these operations may define a Request Body input.
      Response:
        - 200 instead of 204

[GET] /access-profiles/avatars?partnerUserId=partner@cujo.com?includeModifiable=false
implemented. @rasa Maybe the error gets triggered by the second question mark:
  ?partnerUserId=partner@cujo.com?includeModifiable=false -->
  ?partnerUserId=partner@cujo.com&includeModifiable=false
