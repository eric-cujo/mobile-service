   API providing access control for a group of devices via definition of access profile.
   An access profile defines a group of devices that are owned by a single person and a set of policies.
   Applying an access profile for a set of devices starts tracking activity for the access profile.

   Traffic and activity is grouped based on:
   - category (i.e. social category, news category)
   - platform (i.e. facebook, youtube)
   - websites (i.e. wikipedia.org)

   Policies are used to set up restrictions that can be:
   - permanently applied (basic blocking)
   - applied based on time of day and day of the week (schedules)
   - applied based on use (time limit)

   Profiles that are configured reflect current state of the agent.
   Sample workflow with this api would start with creating an access profile with a set of devices,
   and optionally a list of policies that must be applied.
   Later on, once policies have to be adjusted an update request with updated policy configuration has to be made.
   New policy configuration will override all of the data that was stored and updates will come into effect.
